                    <p>In this reading, Carri√≥n explores the role of the "medium" of mail in the creation of mail art. Horrifically, he asserts that mail (i.e., the mail system) serves no purpose other than to transport the art which is created to its intended audience, making it more of a support than a medium. Despite this, mail artists are at the mercy of the mail system for various reasons, including financial costs and limitations in widespread distribution. That makes the Mail, to Carri√≥n, a Big Monster--from there critical discussions surrounding the logistics of creating art can arise.</p>

                    <p>Laurel Schwulst's and √âdouard U's texts touch on how we, as individuals, can leverage the Internet and World Wide Web as a way to nurture individual creativity, expression, and knowledge networks. According to Laurel, that comes in creating a personal website, off of traditional social media platforms, and setting your own rules for how it should look and what it exists to do. As someone who owns a personal website of my own, I learned that I'd like for my website to be a garden, where I can grow and organize different varieties of plants and flowers for display. √âdouard's writing, on the other hand, implores the reader to be more intentional with the way they build their personal knowledge networks, especially with the Internet in hand (surf, not search!). He pushes the importance of interpreting new information within the context of what you know and believe, rather than blindly accepting everything that's written to be true.</p>

                        <li>The fear of being judged on the World Wide Web is very real, especially when anyone with a web browser on their device can view your content. How can we prevent that from stifling creativity and true-to-self work?</li>
                        <li>There are algorithms on social media apps that curate the content you see. Is it possible to leverage these algorithms to build your personal knowledge network, or is that a senseless endeavor?</li>

                    <p>This article emphasizes the value of the Geocities archive in understanding the evolution of the Web. Olia talks about her journey surfing through Geocities neighborhoods and pages one at a time, tagging them with relevant metadata, and debriefs us on what they looked like. There is a distinct feel to surfing these sites; Olia mentions feeling like looking at the ruins of Pompeii. And there is a beauty to it to, the interconnectedness of neighborhoods and the occasional treasure link to a site that still exists today.</p>

                    <p>In this article, Ludovico and Cramer discuss the state of print in the digital age. I found their advocacy for a hybrid print style -- in which both analog and digital print styles are preserved -- particularly interesting. For example, having a QR code on a print magazine that updates periodically: users can return to the same print magazine from time to time to get updates. I also think they bring up an important point about free print: there should be standards around digital print that protect artists from the platforms they produce their work on. There is also the interesting (but in my opinion, somewhat conservative) argument that digital print should not simply digitize analog print, but do something innovative (but personally, I think that's fine). Finally, I think the authors bring up the important point that there are just some things digital prints do better than analog prints (e.g. network effects) but there are some things that analog print has that digital print cannot replicate (the tactile feel of flipping through pages).</p>

                    <p>The reading explores alt-text as an accessibility tool and an artistic practice, emphasizing its role in making visual content accessible for blind and low-vision individuals. It challenges traditional approaches by framing alt-text as a form of poetry, encouraging creativity while maintaining its primary function of accessibility. The authors discuss how alt-text functions as a translation of visual information into text, highlighting subjectivity, audience considerations, and the tension between objectivity and personal interpretation. They also critique existing accessibility practices, advocate for the inclusion of disabled voices in decision-making, and explore the potential of alt-text in artistic contexts.</p>

                    <p>In this article, Ramsey Nasser explores how digital technology reflects cultural biases, especially through programming languages. Nasser developed ŸÇŸÑÿ® (Qalb), a programming language based on Arabic, to show how deeply English is embedded into computing. I found it interesting how even basic tools struggle to handle non-English scripts, making programming difficult for non-English speakers. Nasser argues that real inclusion would require rethinking the entire digital ecosystem beyond just language translation. He suggests that creating truly inclusive technology involves addressing cultural assumptions at every level, not just the surface.</p>

                    <p>Week 10's selection concerns a language that every human on Earth "speaks", the visual language. Unlike traditional languages, which are literal and sequential, the visual language is perceived and simultaneous. And there exists a framework for understanding this language: Gestalt psychology. This psychology posits that human beings view the world in wholes and not constituent parts, discovering that we can be "tricked" into believing certain things, or having certain experiences, through clever organization of visual forms. If the visual language is a language, we can break it down into words, syntax, and grammar. Words: shapes, like squares, circles, and triangles. Syntax: how we organize these shapes into visual forms. And grammar: how we ensure that this organization is (by some defined rules) correct. I had to drive during my recent spring break trip to Mexico, and, despite not speaking an ounce of Spanish, knew that a red octagon with "ALTO" in capital letters, placed on the right side of the street, (probably!) meant stop. And herein exists a language, a language that I understood without needing to know Spanish, composed of a red octagon, placed on the right side of my field of vision, that I understood because it was (grammatically) correct. The article ends with the statement: "if only we could see a photograph of the whole world". The problem is, we perceive the 3D world in 2D. We would have to transcend to some higher dimension to see our 3D world. And I think that's fascinating, despite being physically impossible.</p>

                        <li>If we can think of the visual language as a language, what do new words look like? How are advancements in technology adding new words to our visual language?</li>

                    <p>Dot Tuer's exploration in "Beyond the New Media Frame: The Poetics of Absence in Vera Frenkel's String Games" reveals an intricate intersection of technology, performance art, and memory. Frenkel's pioneering teleconferencing piece, String Games (1974), utilized emerging video technology to explore connections between participants in separate cities, metaphorically bridging physical distance with conceptual intimacy. Tuer illustrates how Frenkel's innovative approach, characterized by "multiple narratives, multiple exchanges, and open-ended outcomes," challenges traditional notions of presence, highlighting instead a poignant poetics of absence. Central to this poetics is Frenkel's symbolic manipulation of absence, where the virtual string game Cat's Cradle metaphorically represents human connections and communication breakdowns simultaneously enabled and limited by technological mediation. This motif becomes a recurring thematic anchor in Frenkel's oeuvre, manifesting deeply in later works such as the Body Missing website (1995). Here, the digital platform itself becomes a means to probe historical traumas, memory, and loss. Tuer emphasizes how Frenkel consistently questions the role of technology, not merely as a facilitator of interactivity but as a critical lens revealing the ephemeral and often elusive nature of human presence and historical remembrance.</p>

                    <p>Paul Soulellis's "Performing the Feed" reimagines what it means to "make public" in a world dominated by endless digital streams. He contrasts the traditional model of publishing‚Äîstatic, intentional, and interruptive‚Äîwith the modern feed: a fluid, continuous performance of information where meaning is often replaced by presence. Posting has evolved from a clear gesture into something ambient, even addictive, where bots, algorithms, and human spectators all play a part. Soulellis raises concerns about how surveillance, automation, and algorithmic flows shape not just what we see, but how we see. In a reality where predictive media and synthetic livestreams may soon feel indistinguishable from truth, he argues that archiving, printing, and disrupting the flow are forms of resistance‚Äîways to reclaim clarity, authorship, and attention.</p>

                    <p>"Beyond Dark Matter" is a rich & imaginative story about power, history, and technology, told through the eyes of a young girl named Gem. While struggling with a school project, Gem is transported inside her computer's operating system‚ÄîThe Way‚Äîa sleek, all-knowing software that hides a worrying reality. Through a surreal and vivid journey aboard a "master train," Gem witnesses a version of history curated by systems of control‚Äîmaster/slave terminology, algorithmic erasure, and a sanitized timeline of Black resistance. But it's only when she leaps into The Beyond, a space of ancestral memory and community voices, that Gem begins to truly understand how deeply embedded histories of violence and care shape the technologies we use today. This story made me realize that it's up to us how we want to write our digital futures, whether our machines are really built to serve us‚Äîor to shape us. Ultimately, like Gem, I have faith that we will find a return to community, finding the meaning that already exists within and around us.</p>

                    <p>Boris Groys explores how the rise of the internet has fundamentally altered the production, presentation, and perception of art and literature. I felt like the points made in the excerpt are especially relevant in certain parts of the Internet, but not so much others. In particular, the points made about defictionalizing art by de-immersing it; the Internet as a machine of surveillance; that creation and exhibition are now simultaneous; and that the process of creating artwork has become artwork itself are moreso true on social media platforms, but less so on your own website(s), where you can control how users navigate through your art pieces, what information they see alongside them, and where you can protect your peace. That being said, this article pinpointed what I don't like about "building in public" -- that feeling of constant exposure that honestly clears the air of mystery artists once held.</p>
